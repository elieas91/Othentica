      'The story of Othentica began with what I witnessed for years: brilliant people quietly drained by pressures, yet carrying an untapped flame of resilience within them.',
      'For more than twenty years in HR and training, I sat with people carrying hidden struggles; the fatigue behind smiles, the pressures they didn’t voice, the emotions that quietly drained their energy and brilliance. I knew those struggles well, because I carried some of them too.',
      'That search led me deeper into brain health, nutrition, and holistic healing. I created programs like Glowing Synapse to help individuals reconnect, and co-founded Conscious Subconscious Training Solutions to spark growth on a deeper level. I also co-authored Expand Your Energy Bandwidth in Times of Epic Change, a book born from the same desire to help people reclaim clarity and resilience during life’s most demanding moments.',
      'Othentica is the evolution of that journey.',
      'It is more than an app or a program, it is a movement to redefine health at work and in life. To me, true health is not an extra benefit, it is the foundation of energy, resilience, and performance.',
      'My purpose is simple and bold: to spark energy, clarity, and resilience so people and workplaces alike can rise above pressures and truly thrive.',
      'Now, I invite you to take this step with me: explore Othentica, light your flame, and discover how powerful life can be when you rise above pressures and step into your authentic self.',
      'Stay Blessed,',

      'Every story has a beginning, and for Tarek, it started with a simple but powerful question: How does stress turn into weight gain?',
      'For years, he heard people say “it’s the stress”, but no one could explain the science behind it. That curiosity became a calling. In 2016, Tarek began researching, blending his background in nursing with certifications in mind-body eating coaching, stress mastery, and mindfulness.',
      'What he discovered was more than science, it was a way of life. Tarek believes the body cannot heal without the soul, and he now helps people master their stress, lift their mood, and rebuild their relationship with food through mindfulness, stress Mastery and meditation.',
      'His journey is one of curiosity turned into purpose: empowering others to find clarity, balance, and happiness by reconnecting mind and body.',
