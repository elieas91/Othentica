    quote: 'I joined Glowing Synapse Program almost 4 weeks ago. For some time, I\'ve been facing some challenges in my personal life, but I didn\'t expect any short-term results. Hiba helped me to connect deep into my heart and kept telling me to focus on myself first and everything else will fall into place and IT HAPPENED. My worries and challenges started to resolve and disappear. It\'s amazing what our hearts and minds are capable of when we decide to focus and connect with them. Thanks Hiba, can\'t thank you enough.',
